Final mark: 87/100

Question 1
Mark: 20/25 
Comment: Excellent approach for the light leaks, especially the rainbow one that seems very close to being realistic. The monochromatic on the other hand, looks a bit less realistic.

Question 2
Mark: 22/25 
Comment: Outstanding approach using Canny edge detection, very close to being realistic. More could have been achieved with a more appropriate combination of input image pre-filtering.

Question 3
Mark: 20/25 
Comment: Excellent filtering and colour grading using L*a*b. Could have been more correct/creative with the smoothing part, using e.g., bilateral filtering for better skin smoothing.

Question 4
Mark: 25/25 
Comment: Perfect work and analysis.
